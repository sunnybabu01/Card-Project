```

### Files:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the profile card.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Project**:
   - Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. **Open the HTML File**:
   - Open `index.html` in a browser to view the profile card.

3. **Customize Content**:
